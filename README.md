To install and run the bot, please follow the steps below:
Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. The bot requires Node.js version 16 or higher. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official website.

Install Dependencies: Install the required dependencies by running the following command: npm install

Configure the Bot: Open the config.json file in the project directory using a text editor. Replace the empty string ("") in the token field with your own Discord bot token. If you don't have a bot token yet, you can create a new bot and obtain the token by following the official discord developer portal guide.
